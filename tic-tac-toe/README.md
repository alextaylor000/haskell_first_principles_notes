Tic-tac-toe in Haskell

Two-player, no AI.

The board is laid out like this:

    1  2  3
 1    |  |
   ---------
 2    |  |
   ---------
 3    |  |

Player 1 is X, Player 2 is O. The player enters a coordinate and will place an X or an O there

A player wins when they get three shapes in a row or column.

- Make a data model that represents the board.
- Write some functions to modify the board, to add an X or an O in a
coordinate
- Write a function that accepts a board and determines if it's a win
- Write a loop to display the board and accept input from the user (see
hangman game for an example)
